Like the motion of a jumping jack, jump your legs wide and then back together. Jump as quickly as you want, but keep your pelvis steady and don't let your booty rise toward the ceiling.",

From this position, stay on your toes with your knees elevated off the floor as you bend your knees and push your hips back, allowing your arms to extend in front of you. This position is almost like a child’s pose in yoga except you’re on your toes and your knees are elevated. You should feel ready to spring forward. Now, spring forward (blast off), pushing off your toes to return to a high plank position.",
